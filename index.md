# 🚀 Self-Distillation - Simple Fine-Tuning for Continuous Learning

[![Download Self-Distillation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download_Self--Distillation-v1.0-brightgreen)](https://github.com/uthmandevsec/Self-Distillation/releases)

## 📖 Overview

Self-Distillation is an advanced algorithm used for fine-tuning machine learning models. This app focuses on On-Policy Self-Distillation from the research paper "[Self-Distillation Enables Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19897)". Our goal is to help models learn constantly without losing what they already know.

Continual learning means models can pick up new skills and knowledge while keeping their previous abilities intact. However, this is a challenge, especially in reinforcement learning, where explicit reward functions are often not available. 

Self-Distillation helps bridge that gap, making it easier to improve models directly from demonstrations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

You’ll need a system with a single H200 GPU to use this software. If your setup differs, adjustments may be necessary. Follow these steps to get started.
